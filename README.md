## What skills are important to success in the knowledge-based economy?

("是什么"类考题)

在知识经济时代,获得成功的重要技能有哪些?




独立思考的技能  对知识经济时代的成功非常重要。它们有助于人们自主开发新想法。例如，拥有独立思考的技能和解决问题的技能的员工往往能找到实用而且有创意的解决办法。沟通技能和团队合作技能对知识经济时代的成功也非常重要，因为它们有助于人们密切合作，实现共同目标。

Independent thinking skills are very important to success in the knowledge-based economy. They help people develop new ideas on their own. For example, employees who have good independent thinking skills and can often find practical and creative solutions to their tasks.
Communacation skills(沟通技能)and teamwork skills(团队合作技能)are also very imporant because they help people to work closely together and achieve their common goal 
the days when a single person could  accomplish a great things are gone.
People need to cooperate, which really highlights how important it is to have good communication skills.


Why do some people choose to do new things instead of the same old things?

他们选择做新的事情，因为他们觉得这比做老一套的事情更有趣、更有动力。
 例如，有些人选择换工作只是为了获得新的体验和不同的视角。

I believe the main reason for that is it's more challenging, which makes them find it more interesting and motivating than doing the same old things.

Doing new things can help them gain new knowledge,  develop new skills and make new friends. 
For example, some of my friends choose to change jobs only for new experiences and a different perspective.


## Do you think schools should teach children how to manage money?

是的，我认为应该这样做，因为理财教育非常重要，应该从小培养、
它不仅能帮助孩子学会如何做预算，为将来存钱，还能帮助他们养成良好的消费习惯。
还能帮助他们养成良好的消费习惯。
Yes, I think they should because financial education is so important that should be cultivated from childhood,
It not only help kid to learn how to make a budget  and save money for the future.
but also  help them develop good spending habits.

我小时候从来没有这样的课程
后来，我长大了，有了工资
我无法抗拒消费、
所以在最初的几年里，我无法存钱。

When I was a kid, I never had courses like that
Then, as I got older and started getting a paycheck
I can not resist spending, 
So, I wasn't able to save a single penny during the first few years of my job.


## Do you think children should learn to make things by hand?
这取决于个人喜好。

首先，我不得不承认，这确实有很多好处。
参与动手制作活动可以让孩子们发挥创造性思维，培养解决问题的能力、
此外，还能培养他们的想象力。
但是，猫的皮不止一种，对吗？
值得考虑的是，还有其他方法可以获得类似的益处。
例如，参加体育运动也能带来类似的好处。
有些孩子可能更喜欢运动而不是手工活动。
每个孩子都有自己的兴趣和天赋，我们应该尊重他们的选择和喜好。

well it depends on individual preferences.
Firstly, I have to admit that it does come with a lot of perks.
Engaging in hands-on crafting activities allows children to think creatively and develop problem-solving skills, 
further more  it can also  foster their imagination as well.
but there more than one way to skin a cat, 
it worth consider there are other way provide comparable benefits
maybe the case children prefer sports rather than crafting
the only thing we can do is encourage them to explore and respect there presences and interest



## What skils can children learn at home but not at school? 
说到实用生活技能，孩子们可以在家里学习烹饪、清洁、预算和个人组织等技能。这些技能对日常生活非常重要，可以帮助孩子们成为更加自立和负责任的人。


在社交技能方面，家庭动态为儿童学习和加强这些能力提供了独特的环境。关键在于，家庭成员往往更加宽容和支持。他们可以始终如一地引导你走向正确的方向，而且总有机会聚在一起深入讨论。这样的机会在学校里很少见。通过这些互动，孩子们可以学会如何认识和管理自己的情绪，如何应对失望，以及如何培养适应能力。这最终会加强他们与家庭成员的关系。


此外，家庭也是培养儿童情商的地方。他们可以学习如何认识和管理自己的情绪，如何应对失望，如何培养抗挫折能力，以及如何与家庭成员建立牢固的关系。这些技能对他们的整体健康和人生成功至关重要。


值得一提的是，学校在培养这些技能方面也发挥着重要作用，但家庭环境为儿童提供了练习和强化这些技能的独特机会。

When it comes to practical life skills, children can learn things like budgeting, and personal organization at home. or some chores like  cooking,Laundry， cleaning, These skills are important for daily life and can help children become more self-sufficient and responsible individuals.

In terms of social skills, family dynamics offer a unique setting for children to learn and reinforce these abilities. The key point is that family members are often more tolerant and supportive. They can consistently guide you in the right direction, and there's always the opportunity to come together and delve into deep discussions. Such opportunities are rarely found in schools. T"All of these help children master common skills in social situations like q recognize and manage their emotions, cope with disappointments, and develop resilience. All these issues they might encounter in social situations.

It's worth mentioning that schools also play a significant role in fostering these skills, but the home environment offers unique opportunities for children to practice and reinforce them.



## Do you think children should be encouraged to think independently?
    ## What skills are important to success in the knowledge-based economy? - indepenent thinking skills
    
    1. independent thinking 很重要 ， Independent thinking is a prerequisite for creative thinking. 可以自己发现观点， 经常能
    2. 小孩子的 独立思考应该从小开始培养， 当我小的时候，我父母就非常在意独立思考的重要性，他们经常引导我任何事情都要问为什么
    my parents placed great importance on independent thinking. They often encurage me to question 'why' in everything.
    and even to this day, I still find it have greate influence on me .

## What are the differences between the way children learn and the way adults learn?
1. 大脑发育：
儿童的大脑处于不断成长和发展的状态。
他们具有很强的适应能力，能够快速吸收新信息、
这意味着他们通常更擅长学习语言或乐器等新知识。
相比之下，成年人的大脑更加发达，这使得他们吸收新信息更加困难，但更容易深刻理解和应用新信息。
Brain Development: Children's brains are 【in a constant state 】of growth and development. 
They are highly adaptable and can absorb new information quickly,

For this reason they can easily absorb new information quickly,

Firstly, I would like to discuss the structural differences between the brains of children and adults.

This means they are generally better at learning new stuff like languages or musical instruments. 
Adults, on the contrast, have more developed brains, which can make it harder for them to absorb new information but easier to deeply underimm and apply it.

2. 已有知识和经验：
先验知识和经验：
关于先验知识，它引出了我要讨论的第二件事
成人在学习时有丰富的已有知识和生活经验可供【借鉴】。这可以帮助他们理解复杂的概念或看到所学知识的实际应用。而儿童往往是第一次学习，因此需要更多的时间来探索，并通过尝试和错误来学习。
Prior Knowledge and Experience:
About why adults can more easily understand complex problems, This brings me to the second point I want to discuss.

regarding the Prior Knowledge,this brings me to the second point I want to discuss.
Adults have a wealth of prior knowledge and life experiences to 【draw upon】 when learning. This can help them understand complex concepts or see the practical applications of what they're learning. Children, however, are often learning things for the first time, thus need more time to explore and learn through trial and error.

Another important factor that affects learning efficiency is...
动机：成人的学习通常更加自主。他们学习往往是因为他们想学，或是为了充实个人，或是为了职业发展。而儿童则往往是因为不得不学（例如学校要求）。这会影响他们的学习动机和学习方法。
When it comes to motivation, adults have more advantages in this regard.
they uually more self-directed or profit-directed in their learning. 
As I mentioned before, 
They often learn because they want to, 
要么是为了充实个人，要么是为了提高专业水平。
either for personal enrichment or professional advancement. 

另一方面，孩子们学习往往是因为他们必须学习，他们必须上学，必须上课。
他们的目的是成为更有教养的人。
他们不需要思考其中的意义。
这会影响他们的学习动机和学习方法。
Children, on the other hand, often learn because they have to , they have to go to school ,and take classed.
they were designed to become some more educated individrals.

They dont have to think meaning inside of it.
This can affect the way they approach the learning process.



情感因素：
情绪因素在学习中也起着重要作用
成人通常更善于管理自己的情绪、
这些品质使他们成为更有效的学习者。

Emotional factors also play an important role in learning ，
adult are often much better at managing their emotions, 
coping with disappointment, they are much more resilient ，these qualities make them more effective learners.



# Which are more important, academic lessons or art lessons?  学术课程更重要还是艺术课程更重要?
I have to say they each have their own perks:

它们各有各的好处、
well they each have their own perks,
例如，学术课程为我们提供了了解周围世界的基础知识，培养了批判性思维能力，并往往为各种职业奠定了基础。
ademic lessons, for instance , they provide us with fundamental knowledge in understanding the world around us, develop critical thinking skills, and often form the basis for a wide range of careers.


另一方面，艺术课能激发创造力，提高我们表达自我的能力，并能让我们更深刻地了解文化和历史。艺术课还能让人放松，释放情绪，这对心理健康非常重要。
On the other hand, art lessons stimulate creativity, enhance our ability to express ourselves, and can provide a deeper appreciation for culture and history. They can also be a source of relaxation and emotional release, which is important for mental health.




两者都非常重要，其中一个的重要性并不一定会降低另一个的价值。
学术课程和艺术课程之间的平衡确实取决于个人的职业发展方向。例如，从事科学、技术、工程和数学领域工作的人可能会觉得学术课程更贴近生活，因为这些科目往往直接应用于他们的工作。然而，美术课所培养的创造力和解决问题的能力在这些领域也很有价值。
Both of them are so important and the importance of one doesn't necessarily diminish the value of the other
The balance between academic and art lessons can indeed depend on one's career path. For example, someone pursuing a career in a STEM field might find academic lessons more immediately relevant, as these subjects often directly apply to their work. However, the creativity and problem-solving skills fostered in art lessons can also be valuable in these fields.

相反，对于那些从事创意产业或人文学科的人来说，艺术课可能更直接适用于他们的工作。但学术课程可以提供更广泛的背景和分析技能，从而丰富他们的工作。
Conversely, for those in creative industries or humanities, art lessons might be more directly applicable to their work. But academic lessons can provide a broader context and analytical skills that can enrich their work.

总之，学术课程和艺术课程都有其独特的价值。两者之间的平衡可因个人目标和职业道路而异，但理想的全面教育是将两者结合起来。
In conclusion, both academic and art lessons have their own unique value. The balance between the two can vary depending on individual goals and career paths, but a well-rounded education would ideally incorporate both.



## What are the qualities that good teachers have? (“是什么” 类考题)

第一，一般好的教师都非常的专业，他们都对自己所教授的内容非常了解， 这个是基础，有了这个基础，他们可以更好地引导和启发学生
更加容易的了解学生遇到的困难
第二 要有一定的人文精神， 一个好的老师首先要有足够的人格魅力， 这样可以吸引学生去效仿
另外好的老师一般会很有耐心有幽默感， 这样可以让学生们更加有动力去学习
最后要有足够的教学技巧， 不同的学生有不同的天赋和偏好， 要根据不同的人去使用不同的教学方法，还比如说， 善于启发学生去思考，帮助学生建立自信

首先，一流的教师对他们所教的学科知识非常了解。这是他们的大本营，从这里他们可以引导学生，点亮他们的心灵。这也有助于他们发现和解决学生可能遇到的任何问题。
First off, top-notch teachers are super knowledgeable about the subjects they teach. This is their base camp,from 
where they can guide students and light up their minds. It also helps them spot and tackle any problems students might run into.

其次，他们有人情味。一名优秀的教师需要有吸引学生的磁性人格，让学生愿意追随他们的脚步。此外，他们通常很有耐心，而且风趣幽默，能让学生对学习充满热情。

Next up, they've got this human touch. A standout teacher needs to have a magnetic personality that draws students in, making them want to follow their footsteps. Plus, they're usually patient, and they've got a funny bone, which can really get students fired up about learning.

最后，他们还必须具备高超的教学技巧。每个学生都是独一无二的个体，都有自己的特长和爱好，因此教师需要针对不同的学生变换自己的教学风格。
比如，对于那些有点害羞或不自信的学生，他们应该善于激发学生的好奇心，增强他们的自信心，鼓励他们把自己的观点说出来。但对于那些自以为无所不知的学生，教师应鼓励他们敞开心扉，多考虑别人的想法。
And finally, they've got to have killer teaching skills. Every student is a unique individual with their own strengths and talant, so teachers need to switch up their teaching style for each one. 
like for students who are a bit ubsure about themself they should be good at sparking curiosity in students and boosting their confidence,      encourage them to put their views out there. But for those who might think they know it all, teachers should encourage them to open up their mind and consider other people's ideas.




How has teaching changed in your country? (对比类考题)


中国正处于重大转型的阵痛期、
因此，我们上一代人所受的教育与这一代人形成了鲜明的对比
几十年前，教育资源匮乏、
经验丰富的教师少之又少。教育主要是标准化的，重在传播知识和技能。主要目的是使其易于消化，而不是深入研究其原理。虽然这个问题在某种程度上至今仍然存在、
China is in the throes of significant transformation, 
so there's a stark contrast between the education  our previous generation received  and current generation 
A couple of decades back, educational resources were scant, 
and seasoned teachers were few and far between. The education was primarily standardized, with a heavy emphasis on disseminating knowledge and skills. The main objective was to make it easily digestible, without delving deep into the  principles under the hood. While this issue persists to an extent today, there's a drastic increase in educational resources.

但教育资源却大幅增加。你看，很多学生都在校外选修额外的课程，以便真正深入学习。因此，最近我们看到了很多有才华的人涌现出来"。
 a lot of students are taking extra classes outside of school to really dive deep into their studies. So, we're actually seeing a lot of talented individuals coming up these days."




# What are  advantages and disadvantages of giving prizes to children who do well at school?
我对让孩子们从小就进入激烈竞争的深渊持保留意见。
但是，我不得不承认，这样做确实有很多好处。
奖品可以激励孩子，帮助他们在学校发挥潜能。
例如，在学校数学竞赛中获奖的孩子将来可能会更加努力地学习数学。
但是，当一个孩子得到奖品时，另一个孩子就会错过。
没有获奖的孩子可能会觉得自己受到了不公平的待遇。
他们可能会认为自己在这一领域并不优秀，从而降低继续深造的动力。


I do have my reservations about thrusting kids into the deep end of fierce competition at an early age. 
but , I have to admit that it does come with a lot of perks. 

Rewarding children can motivate them to learn more and help them reach their potential in school. /
Prizes can motivate children and help them reach their potential in school. 


For instance, children who win prizes in some field are likely to study even harder in the future. 
But when one kid gets the prize, another misses out.
Those who did not win the prize might feel they were treated unfairly. 
they might believe they're not good in this field and become less motivated to pursue further studies.


这可能会让孩子们认为，接受奖励才是上学的主要目的、
而不是获得技能和知识。
要知道，我一直认为，全面发展的教育应包含一切。教育的根本目的应该是帮助孩子们形成理性的基础，而不是一味地被功利所驱使，或者像被利益所驱使。



这可能会让孩子们认为，接受奖励才是上学的主要目的，而不是获得技能和知识。
因为你知道，大多数情况下，你的辛勤付出不会立即得到回报，但这时坚持下去是非常重要的

你知道，我一直认为，全面的教育应该包含一切。教育的根本目的应该是帮助孩子形成人格基础，而不是一味地受功利驱使。
And this could lead children to believe that receiving rewards is the main purpose of going to school , rather than gaining skills and knowledge. 
chileren usually have time to think the meaning inside of it;
f
While sometimes hard work often doesn't bring instant rewards, it is crucial for children to persevere during these times.
Indeed, there are some problems with the current education system.

For long term development,children need to be ethusiasims and self-motivated.,  or like konwing how to cope with native stuff they might run into in learning process.

Material rewards may not be of much help in this regard.

So I firmly  believe that a well-rounded education should ideally incorporate everything. It should involve understanding human nature,The fundamental purpose of education should help chidren to form basis of personality,  not always soly being driven by utility or profit.


but Both material rewards and spiritual encouragement are considered as rewards.
cultivating a sense of honor in children is very beneficial for their long-term development.

# Will the traditional classroom disappear in the future? 展 望未来类考题)

 未来，传统课堂可能会越来越少，但我不认为它们会完全消失。学生可能会花更多时间在网上学习。例如，许多大学的讲座都被搬到了网上，让学生可以随时随地进行学习。

说到语言课程，就像我参加的英语学习项目，我们使用在线和离线相结合的方法。与此同时，视频通话也变得非常流行，我和我的同事经常使用它。

新的在线学习模式有许多优点。它在时间安排上提供了更大的灵活性，节省了大量通勤时间。然而，传统的面对面会议并没有完全消失。这是因为人与人之间的互动不能局限于电脑屏幕。我们需要真实的互动来建立联系，更好地融入社区，从而实现共同的目标。

我突然想到了在许多科幻电影中看到的场景，人们生活在虚拟的网络世界中，感觉无比真实。如果技术发展到那个地步，那么传统课堂可能就真的消失了。

 In the future, traditional classrooms may become less common, but I don't believe they will disappear entirely. It is likely that students will spend more time studying online. For instance, many university lectures are being moved online to allow students to access them anytime and anywhere.

but most likely they've got to use a combination of online and offline methods. because they both have their own perks

the online learning mode , for instance, It offers greater flexibility in terms of scheduling and saves a lot of commuting time. 
However,  face-to-face  lets us connect  closely and directly, it brings us together and delve into deep topics,
human interaction cannot be confined to a computer screen. We need real interaction to establish connections and better integrate into a community, which enables us better to achieve common goals.

我突然想到在许多科幻电影中看到的场景，人们生活在虚拟的网络世界中，感觉无比真实。如果技术发展到那一步，那么传统教室可能就真的消失了。
It just hit me that the scenes I've seen in many sci-fi movies, where people live in a virtual online world that feels incredibly real. If technology ever advances to that point, then traditional classrooms might truly disappear.


工作：

# What kinds of jobs do young people like to do in your country?
在我国，年轻人的职业偏好多种多样。
但我们中的许多人都被软件开发、数据分析和数字营销等相关领域的职业所吸引。
因为它提供了令人兴奋的创新和发展机会。

In my country, young people are quite diverse in their career preferences. 
But  many of us are drawn to the career in stem field, such as software development, data analysis, and digital marketing， Mechanical engineer. 
as it provide exciting opportunities for innovation and growth.and also they usually have good salary as well.

从大方向来讲， 一个国家是否繁荣昌盛取决于高附加值产业，而工程师和科学家是高附加值产业的基础
It means that, from a macro perspective, whether a country is prosperous and thriving depends on high-value-added industries, and engineers and scientists form the foundation of these high-value-added industries。

For the vast majority of ordinary people, having a job with decent pay is very important.
it's allow us to live comfortably.

Apart from this, distance is also a very important factor. We don't want to spend too much time on commuting.

# Which is better, staying in the same job for a long time or changing jobs every few years?


In my view, both fo them have their own benefits. 
If a person stays in the same role for a long period, they are more likely have greater opportunities for upward mobility within their company.
Long-term employees are usually more valued by their employers due to their loyalty and accumulated knowledge. 

Additionally, maintaining the same job for many years can foster stronger relationships with colleagues, creating a more collaborative and enjoyable work environment.

On the other hand, changing jobs every few years also has its unique advantages.
it can keep us dynamic and engaging with our work and life.
prevent individuals from falling into monotonous routines or job burnout, 

1. you can develop new skills keeps your profile versatile and appealing
2. travel new palace, take different perspective to perceive the world.
3. you can always pursing exiting opportunities for innovation and growth and good salary as well

all these could be beneficial for both of your personally and professionally. 
which is much more captivation than doing the same old things.



# What are the differences between older employees and young employees?

他们在工作时可以借鉴丰富的专业知识
他们通常需要花时间去探索，通过尝试和错误来学习。
他们通常能理解引擎盖下的原理
此外，多年从事同一份工作可以增进与同事的关系，从而创造一个更具协作性、更愉快的工作环境。



另一方面，年轻员工往往充满抱负和活力。
他们通常学得快，适应能力强。
年轻员工通常善于学习新技能和新技术、
因为他们习惯于快节奏的现代工作环境。
他们乐于接受变化，很容易适应新环境。

他们思想开放，愿意接受新思想和新方法，他们有全新的视角，不怕打破常规思维。

因此，他们更容易提出有创意的想法。

prior knowledge:
they have wealth of prior knowledge to draw upon when they are working
they often complete their work in efficient way
as they can see the practical application of what they are doing.
they can usually deeply understand the principles under the hood 
but youngsters
usually have to take time to explore and learn though trial and error.


On the other hand, young employees are often full of ambition and energy.
They are typically quick learners and adaptable. 
as they are accustomed to the fast-paced nature of the modern working environment. 
They are comfortable with change and can easily adapt to new situations.

they are open-minded and willing to embrace new ideas and approaches,

therefore they are more likely to come up with creative ideas. 
generally , all of them have their advantages, we Engaging with them sincerely and better accomplishing our goals.


# do you think woman should be able to do all the same jobs than men do?
I believe women should be able to pursue most of the jobs that men do. 
People should be judged based on their abilities rather than their gender. 
Therefore, women should have equal job opportunities as men in today's knowledge-based economy. 



但是同时我们也应该观察到性在维持社会运转的过程中其中的差别，合理的利用这些差别

we should also acknowledge the differences that gender brings in maintaining the functioning of society 
and make reasonable use of these differences.
Generally speaking, men are often associated with a greater sense of adventure. 
They are perceived to be able to handle higher levels of stress and possess more energy.

On the other hand, women are often shows a sense of empathy and understanding
I mean they are considered to be more attentive and empathetic. 

They tend to be more sensitive to the emotions of others and are more likely to understand and share in both their sorrows and joys.

therefore they are usually are effective learners at certain fields like languages, instrument or art 

It is completely normal for men and women to have different preference based on their respective strengths.



# What are some problems that might be caused by using the internet?

there is lot of issues caused by internet 


网上信息浩如烟海，要想一一筛选可能会让人不知所措。人们可能难以区分可靠信息和不准确信息。我们有可能被某些信息误导，导致对事物的不公正评价，甚至成为网络诈骗的受害者。互联网为诈骗和欺诈活动提供了温床，导致经济损失和个人信息泄露。保护网上个人信息已成为现代社会的一大挑战。网上共享的个人数据容易受到黑客攻击，并很容易被滥用。

With the vast amount of information available online, it can be overwhelming to filter through it all. 
People may struggle to distinguish between reliable and inaccurate information. 
There is a possibility that we may be misled by certain information, result in unjust evaluations of matters
produce prejudice and we ourself may falling victim to online scams. 
it's worth mentioning that the Internet provides a breeding ground for scams and fraudulent activities, 
resulting in financial loss and compromised personal information. 
it already posted a great challenge of protecting our personal information
which is vulnerable to hacking and can be easily abused. 


everyone can ware a mask if you want

the nature of anonymity of internet also result in many other problem, such as cyberbully
which involves the use of technology to harass, intimidate, or humiliate others. 
This can have severe emotional and psychological effects on the victims.
I recently came across a news story where a girl faced attacks from others due to some inappropriate remarks, and tragically, she ended up taking her own life.

further More ， The Internet offers a wide range of entertainment landscape that can be addictive. 
Excessive use of the Internet can lead to time management issues, affecting productivity and personal relationships.


Social Isolation: While the Internet connects people globally, excessive reliance on online interactions can lead to social isolation. Spending too much time online may reduce face-to-face interactions, affecting social skills and overall well-being.

Negative Impact on Mental Health: Constant exposure to social media and online platforms can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and depression. Comparing oneself to others' curated online lives can negatively impact mental well-being.

It's important to note that the Internet itself is not the root cause of these problems, but rather how it is used. Being aware of these issues and taking necessary precautions can help mitigate the negative consequences of Internet usage.

# Which do you think are better , emails or hand-written letters?
definitely it's email.  because they are free and they arrive immediately,
With emails, you can communicate with someone across the globe in a matter of seconds.
Additionally, emails provide a record of communication that can be easily searched and referenced.
eliminating the need to prepare envelopes, and stamps, 
handwriting, on the other hand,  the re‘cipient have to wait for a long time to receive them.
not to mention the possibility of them getting lost

But I suppose hand-written letters are better when we want to express love or appreciation
Handwritten notes express a sense of enthusiasm or sincerity.
because hand-written letters feel more personal  than emails.


How will the internet develop in the future ?
互联网在未来将会如何发展?
1 第一个随着文明的发展 互联网带来的很多问题都会被解决，
目前互联网有很多问题
 比如数据安全问题 个人隐私问题， 还有其他的赛博霸凌 或者利用虚假信息实现其他的目的
 这些东西在目前很难被监管， 未来随着人来文明的发展和进步 都会渐渐的变好

另外 互联网一定会更加便捷，深入到生活的方方面面，提供方便的应用，我注意到世界其他地方没有国家像中国一样在各种生活细节方面提供非常方便便捷的互联网应用， 人们可以很容易的使用手机搞定很多事情， 不只是使用手机购买车票， 或者订酒店这种事情， 比如绝大多数的餐厅都可以用手机点餐和排队，比如在每个桌角有一个二维码， 你坐下就可以自己点单， 如果一家店比较火， 你可能需要排队， 可以直接手机排号， 你可以在手机上面看到你前面还有多少人， 你可以在等待的时候去做其他的事情， 逛逛商场超市， 
这些东西再国外都没有， 我相信随着时间推进这些都会有的
with the civalization ptrocessed , many issues plague the in intenet will be well addressed. 
the have with many problems in the internet such cyberblully , faudulent activity, or compromised of personnal data
these is tough to manage at the moment,but as times goes on , I pretty optimisetic they can be well handed.

Furthermore, the internet will undoubtedly become more convenient, 
penetrating into various aspects of life, 
providing convenient applications. 
like China
People can easily handle almost every things with  phones, not just buying tickets or booking hotels. 
For example, the vast majority of restaurants allow mobile ordering and queuing. For instance, there is a QR code at each table corner, 
enabling you to place your order as soon as you sit down. If a restaurant is busy, you may need to wait in line, but you can join the queue directly on your phone. 
You can see how many people are ahead of you on your phone and use the waiting time to do other things like browsing in malls or do some groceries. 
As I noticed these conveniences are not available in other countries, but I believe they will become commonplace as time goes on.


# What are the advantages and disadvantages of using mobile phones?
好处 super handy eawy to get to , 
you can talk to someone accross the globe in a matter of second

reduce chance to people,  some of us prefer to stay at home
making phone calls while drving
rely too much on phones and spend too much time surfacing on internet


# Do you think children should spend more time playing outdoor games?
 I do believe that kids should spend more time playing outside. 
 engaging physical activity not only help children to improve problem-solving skills, 
 enhance hand-eye coordination, and even foster teamwork and social skills
 but also a good chance to explore and learn about the world in a hands-on way. 
 it's also can be a good source of relaxation and emotialnal release,  is super important for both their health and mental health, 
Plus, it's great for them break from screens and electronics, which we all know can be a bit too much sometimes.


好处和坏处都从 身体 精神 文化（对社会影响）三个方面去阐述

# What are the benefits and drawbacks of playing video games for children?
engaging video game not only help children to improve problem-solving skills, enhance hand-eye coordination, and even foster teamwork and social skills
educational games can really fire up children about there learning , help children learn new concepts in a fun and engaging way.they provider depper areciation of cultrue and history
it's also can be a good source of relaxation and emotional release,  

Excessive gaming can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and potentially contribute to health issues like obesity. 【ao bi 色ty】
It can also be addictive, leading to decreased academic performance and social isolation i f not managed properly. 
Furthermore, some video games may contain violent or inappropriate content that can negatively impact a child's behavior and mindset.

In conclusion, while playing video games in moderation can offer certain benefits, 
it's important for parents to monitor and regulate their children's gaming habits to ensure a healthy balance with other activities and responsibilities.

# What are the advantages and disadvantages of using robots?
Using robots comes with its own set of pros and cons. 
On the bright side,  robots can work tirelessly without getting tired,they can automate repetitive (re pet titive) tasks, making processes more efficient and saving time. 
They can take over dangerous or hazardous（嗨z dei s） jobs to keep our safe. 

However, there are drawbacks to consider as well. One major concern is the potential loss of jobs as robots replace human workers in certain industries. 
There's also the issue of cost - acquiring and maintaining robots can be expensive. 
Moreover, there are ethical considerations surrounding the use of robots, 

such as the impact on interpersonal relationships when human interaction is replaced by machines.
This reminds me the  story I came across on sifi movies, where a human and a robot fell in love, but their relationship faced challenges from tradition beliefs, and tragically, the robot sacrificed itself to save the hero's life
and this raises a big topic: whether artificial intelligence should have human rights.
How to determine if robots truly have human emotions?
but If technology ever advances to that point, societal beliefs will also change accordingly.

In conclusion, while robots offer many benefits in terms of efficiency and safety, 
it's important to weigh these advantages against the potential drawbacks like job displacement and ethical concerns. 
Balancing the use of robots with human labor and considering the broader societal implications is crucial in harnessing the full potential of robotics.


# Why do some people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally-produced films?
foreign film scenes, like Hollywood, they dominate because they've got strong and wide-reaching cultural vibes.
they are all very well made,right from the script to the special effects to the performance, they're all world-class
they've got deep pockets for special effect and renowned actors, whose presence can heavily influence the worth of the movie.
they could have powerful attraction as well1.
Innovation and fresh elements in terms of plot and cinematography give them an edge that's hard to replicate in domestic films.
furthermore they cover a wider range of themes - science fiction, superhero, history, romance among others -to cater to different spectators,
All these factors significantly contribute to the viewing experience.

# What are the differences between watching a film in the cinema and watching a film at home?
the screen is much larger in cinema and the sound quality in the cinema is better, 
It also feels special to share the experience of watching a film with many other viewers, 
On the other hand, it's cheaper and more convenient to watch a film at home. 
And watching a film at home is more comfortable for people who don't like sitting in a crowded place.


but  I'm not really a big fan of going to the cinema, to be honest. Watching movies online saves a lot of commuting time for me.
At home, I can just chill and relax while watching a film. It's so much more comfortable - 
I can snack, pause whenever I want, or even rewind if I missed something. 
I don't have to sit through a whole movie in one go. I can go bathroom whenever I want.

but cinema is also a good place to hang out with your friends,  if my friends or girl friend like it, I will totally buy it.
It's nice to go see it occasionally.

# What kind of influence do TV shows have on children ?
TV shows can really impact children in significant ways. They can greatly influence kids' interests, mindsets, and behaviors. 
educational digital media can help them understand conceptions in a fun and engaging way. they provide basics knowledge in understanding the world around uss
some of them can instill positive values such as sharing and kindness, which is great for their emotional health and form of well rounded personality
but we all known it could a bit much sometimes
It can be addictive, leading to decreased academic performance
it could contains inappropriate contend that could create negative impact for children's behavior and mindset
such as alcohol , drug use, smoking, and sexual behavior before they are emotionally ready to understand. 
as watching tv have certain benefits, 
it's important for parents to monitor and regulate their children's watching habits to ensure a healthy balance with other activities and responsibilities.


# Do you think people watch less television nowadays than they did in the past ?

Yeah, people definitely watch less TV nowadays compared to before.
With smartphones and computers, we can easily get info anytime and anywhere, 
so we don't have to stick to a TV schedule. 
but TV still has its perks. Bigger screen, better sound, 
and it's convenient to share you watching experience with your family
Plus, with smart TVs, we can watch whatever we want on demand. 
But the development of the latest technology may change all these trend,
like VR technology , people lives in a virtual world that fells incredible real,if technic ever advance to that point,
the television will disappear completely .

# What kinds of live performances are popular in your country?
well , young people are really into diverse cultural stuff nowadays.
the first thing that came in my mind is we have called cross talk, which is chinese traditional shows, it's kinda like stand-up comedy.
, it's usually performed by two people, one telling jokes and the other playing the fool.

and talk shows are gaining popularity as well, 
especially in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. There are a lot of live comedy shows happening offline

but Older folks might prefer traditional dramas. 
Each region in China has its own traditional theater, like Peking Opera, which is quite famous. 
Besides Peking Opera, there are many other traditional performances as well.


as entertainment landscape in china is incredibly vibrant , we can see many fancy things coming up these days 
I've been to some comic expos in China, where they have all sorts of events like anime-themed concerts.
Personally, I alway been into those concerts or famous singers' shows. 
It's a great place to hang out with friends and  it's nice to have a good time once in a while.


# Do you think newspapers are important to us
well,  I don't believe they serve any purpose anymore.
I don't think so. With smartphones and computers, we can easily get info anytime and anywhere, 
right from the everything that happening in world to the latest pop culture, we can get them in a matter of seconds.
Newspapers are just too slow in delivering information. It takes a lot of manpower to print and distribute, 
which is nowhere  as convenient as electronic media. Not to mention the possibility of them getting lost or delivered to the wrong address.
or stolen by someone on purpose,
It might just be that everyone is used to it, so it's hard to change.
Humans have been using technology to replace human labor. 
it's becomes commonplace that we get rid of them, I believe it will disappear completely sooner or later

# Do you think newspapers will disappear in the future?

No, I think they should disappear right now.


# What is the role of parents in their children's development?
parent definitely play an important role in their children's development,
in terms of practical skills
parent can help them learn to do some chores to help them to be more self sufficient and achieve their responsibility
they help them to make some budgeting , help them to save money for their future

1. Family members can often get together to enjoy each other's company,like gether around the table for meal and enjoy other's company,  which makes children feel warmth. 
This is very beneficial for developing a well-rounded personality.
children spread kindness and warmth, making them well-liked by others. It is very beneficial for them in forming good interpersonal relationships.

2.
By offering consistent support, and discipline,
parents create a foundation of trust and safety. This stability allows children to explore the world with confidence, 
they can always get together and delve into deep topics
they are usually more supportive and tolerant, they constantly guid them to the right place.
By discussing a wide range of subjects, parents encourage critical thinking, curiosity, and a love for learning. 
These discussions can provide a safe space for children to express their thoughts and feeling witch is great for social skills
In conclusion, parents play a multifaceted role in their children's development, from teaching practical life skills to providing emotional support and intellectual stimulation. 
Their involvement is crucial in shaping well-rounded, responsible, and emotionally intelligent individuals.



# How have relationships between parents and children changed in your country?
  In the past, parents spend much tims with their children 
they help them do some chores to help them to become more self sufficient
they often engage in various physical activities with their children, such as playing sports


but things changed, most parents find themselves juggling demanding careers that require a substantial amount of their time and energy. 
Children's academic pressure has also become very intense.
many find themselves absorbed in individual pursuits.
The  time they do spend together is often fragmented and less interactive.
otherwise silently surfing the Internet, chatting on social media or playing video games.
This shift highlights the growing challenge of balancing professional responsibilities with family life, and underscores the importance of finding ways to reconnect and strengthen family bonds in the digital age.


# Why do many people have children later in life these days?
现在为什么很多人更晚要孩子?

most parents find themselves juggling demanding careers that require a substantial amount of their time and energy. 
they find themselves absorbed in individual pursuits.
many individuals prioritize establishing and advancing their careers before starting a family
success of creer often means further education and extra training 
leaving little room for the responsibilities that come with raising children.  

Raising children is more expensive than in the past.
you have to devote a large amount of responsibility and time to raise a child
When we become better ourselves, our expectations for our children also become higher.
Furthermore, by having children later,  we can better educate our children and provide them with better conditions.
which makes kid to explore the world with confident


# Do you think there is a right age for young adults to stop living with their parents?
In my country, this is not a big deal.As long as they are not married and workplace close to home,it's perfect ok to stay with your parents,  
Even when they are grow up, parents still see them as their children.. 

parents hope to continue living together. but young people have different idea. as grow up and start to get their own paycheck, 
they don't want to be under their parents' control. They want to order takeout, stay up late,
 arrange their rooms according to their own preferences, and hang out with their friends.

But I think we should not  rely too much on our parents. 
if we live  together , we should help do some chores and help with cooking
personality as I found my first job, around 22 years of age, I went to metropolis and live independently



# How has the size of the average family changed in your country?(对比类考题)在你们国家里平均的家庭规模有什么变化?
the size of family get smaller , in old days, people were heavily influenced by traditional beliefs
you have to give birth much to extend your family as much as possible 
and people need to unite more to withstand risks.
but nowadays , things changed , 
rasing child is much more expensive, as need devote much responsibly and time energy to raise a child
further more, people absorbed in individual pursuits , which means extra time for training and further education.
they don't want to spend much time to give birth and raise a child.
many individuals prioritize establishing and advancing their careers before starting a family
but in other hand, as long we have child , we want give them the best education and economic condition, to allow them to
explore the world with confidence.
the main concerns is our child do not live happiness.
I think that is the reason why they are give birth less these days.
but I pretty enjoy life in old days,whole family gether around the table for diner,  sharing stories during day time  and enjoy each others company.
but the days was gone, we have to accustom to the nature of modern society

# What are the advantages and disadvantages of living alone?
People who live alone enjoy more freedom and more privacy
They also tend to be more independent and have better life skills.
For instance, young people who live alone better at cooking and repairing things than those who live with their parents. 
as for myself , the experience of live alone help me achieve self sufficient and become more responsibility
when I was live with my parent, I did not do cooking, and help to do the house work, which I think it;s unfair to my parent.
and after I graduate and got my first job, say about  23 or 23 , I move to metropolises and live independently
i learn many practical skills.
and  live alone may contribution to social isolation.
as for my own experience, When I live alone, I feel lonely. All my social activities are limited to online interactions. 
I find myself less and less inclined to make new friends over times.


# Do you think men and women should share the housework equally?
Definitely.Just as I believe women should same job opportunities as men.
women also should share the same housework.
And couples who share the housework equally are more likely to have a 
happy marriage because they respect and care about each other.
But I think two people don't need to draw clear lines. 
Personally, I don't like to be overly calculative.I don't mind doing a bit more.
But I also need to find someone who thinks the same way as I do.
we all take responsibility and manage to make our life better.

We should also acknowledge the differences that gender brings in maintaining the functioning of family. 
Men are often associated with a sense of power and can handle more heavy work,
while women are generally more considerate. and they often shows a sense of empathy and understanding.
they are better performance to handle problem such as communication and societal problem
 It's perfectly normal for men and women to have different task preferences, 
and we should respect our different strengths.

# Do you think that women are more emotional than men?
I would say in general, women are more emotional.
For example, sad scenes in films or in TV drama series are more likely to make female viewers cry. 
women are usually shows a sense of empathy and understanding  
They tend to be more sensitive to the emotions of others and are more likely to understand and share in both their sorrows and joys.
Take my own experience, for example. I’ve noticed that my female friends are often the first to offer comfort when someone is feeling down. 
They seem to pick up on subtle emotional cues that men might miss. This ability to empathize deeply can be really helpful in both personal and professional relationships.
 but these are generalizations and not all women are the same.  It really depends on the individual. 


# Who do you think should be responsible for caring for elderly people?
I think both the government and kids have their roles to play. 
The government should take care of healthcare and living costs because these folks have worked hard all their lives and given a lot to society. 
They deserve a good retirement. 
Kids, on the other hand, should be there for their parents,
offering companionship and detailed care.
The government can only provide the basics , but as kids, we want them to live comfortably, 
just like they did to us when we were young. 
Therefore, it is essential to provide both emotional companionship and material support.
Living together as a family and enjoying a warm, cozy home is really important.


# What are the problems caused by population ageing?

Population ageing can lead to a variety of issues that affect both individuals and society as a whole. 
1. 
first that came in my mind is Increasing Healthcare Costs ，  
It will increase the burden on the government, and the budget allocated to other areas will be reduced.
Older individuals generally require more medical attention, long-term care.
and even worse the tax income may not cover the costs , that would be terrible


 2.  pension systems can become strained. There may not be enough working-age individuals to support the pension payouts,
  leading to potential financial instability in these systems.



3. With fewer people in the workforce, there can be a slowdown in economic growth. 
Companies may face labor shortages, and there could be a decrease in consumer spending, 
which can affect businesses and the economy overall.

but it;s just generalizations , As the country develops, it always happens.It's just a matter of degree.

# Why is friendship important?
We can do some fun things together. we shared the common goals, hobbies, and mutual friends.
You can make plans and go on trips together.
you share both of your sorrow and joys
your friend often the first to provide comfort when I was feeling down

with your friends encourage and companionship, you can do things you didn't dare to do before.
they help you achieve your potentials
You can learn many good qualities from your friends and become better yourself.

friends can really help you with your interpersonal and professional 
you share information and help each looking for a job-hopping or get prompted
Humans are social animals after all. Often, they unit more to withstand risks.


# What are important qualities for friends to have?
a good friend should help you in both interpersonal and professional relationsships 
  - Why is friendship important?
  a good sense of humor is also important , where you think he is funnuy to want to be with him 


# In your opinion, what is success?
Personally, I think success can be anything that a person achieves through effort.
It can be something very simple,like cooking a nice meal for our family or friends. 
On the other hand, it can also be something that takes a longtime to achieve,getting a diploma, making more money ,  achieving our career goals.

I have seen many people who possess wealth and status, they work hard and they study hard when they were student
but they live every day under great pressure and anxiety. 

Can this be considered as success?
some of them are pretty accustomed with the fast pace of the working environment
they say As long  you enjoy your current lifestyle and can keep moving forward,
if you work hard you reap the reward 
 you feel satisfied with your current work , that's what matt ers.

but some of them not, they chose their job just because high salary 
So, I think someone's success depends on whether they feel content inside.
if their hart not full filled , I wont call them success



# Do you think that successful people are always happy people? 
So, I think someone's success depends on whether they feel content inside.
if their hart not full filled , I wont call them success


# Why do many people want to become famous?
Once you become famous, you can gain status and wealth.
Fame brings respect and access to many resources without the need for hard work
Being famous allows us to do what we want, rather than working just to make a living.
we can travel hangout  with diffrence people
but fame doesn't always bring happiness.
It's important to balance dreams with reality and remember that true contentment often comes from within and through meaningful relationships. 
Chasing fame can be a wild ride, but it's not the only path to a fulfilling 



Do you often wear jewelry?
不，我根本不戴珠宝 男的戴装饰品在我看来非常的娘， 而且宝石其实并不具有实际上的高价值，只是一些商家炒作起来的噱头
但是如果女孩喜欢的话，I mean girl friend，  我会买下来给她们
Nah, I don't wear jewelry at all. , wearing bling is bit too flashy for the guy like me ,  And honestly, gems don't really hold that high value in reality, 
it's just a marketing gimmick hyped up by sellers. But if a girl likes it, I mean like a girlfriend, I'd totally buy it for her.


What type of jewelry do you like to buy?
钻石， 因为意味着恒久的爱情， 当然我不太相信这个，如果我买的话， 我会买人造的，外表几乎一样， 并且可以省下一大笔钱
Diamonds, because they're supposed to symbolize everlasting love, right? Not that I totally buy into that, but if I were to get some, I'd go for the artificial ones. They look nearly identical and can save me a tons of cash.

 Why do you think some people wear a piece ofjewelry for a long time?
 一方面有一些迷信在里面， 例如在中国， 人们相信玉可以帮人抵挡灾祸，如果有一天毫无预兆的突然碎了， 那么代表着他为你挡了一劫
 另一方面， 佩戴名贵的宝石是财富和地位的象征， 如果你经常出入于高端场合，你需要宝石来彰显你的地位。

 On one hand, there is some superstition involved.
 like you known , in China, people believe that jade can protect you from misfortunes .
 If it suddenly shatters without any reason, It means it took a take a bullet for you.

另一方面，宝石被视为财富和地位的象征。
it's a  symbol of wealth and status.
If you often mingle in upper classes , you kinda need those jewels to show off your standing.

 1) 你了解过外太空和星星吗？
1) Have you ever learned about outer space and stars?
我一直对宇宙的奥秘非常着迷
我读了很多科幻小说、电影等

I've always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe
I read much sifi novel ，films etc
我还是小孩子的时候，有一部科教片 ，探索土星生命， 我看了非常多遍
银河系、黑洞，宇宙中所有这些令人遐想的疯狂事物都非常的吸引我。
我学得越多，就越意识到还有多少东西有待发现。
时至今日这仍然使我保持兴奋
When I was a child, there was a science documentary about exploring life on Saturn that I watched countless times.
This sparked a great interest in the universe for me.
The glaxy, black holes, and all these wildly fascinating things in the universe attracted me much. 
But I found that ,The more I learned, the more I realized how much there is still to discover. 
So that's why even To this day, these still keeps me excited.

2) 您对外太空和星空电影感兴趣吗？
2) Are you interested in films concerning outer space and stars?
Interstellar, a famouse movie right ? it's about an astronaut  roam through space to save the world from great disaster. he trapped into black hole and then by chance, and ends up going back in time.  

but soon he found out that he can  he can somehow influence the space his daughter is in

In a way that is difficult for an ordinary person to understand.
他用一种微妙的方式向女儿传达了一个信息，这个消息拯救了地球。
He conveyed a message to his daughter in a subtle way,  
the message is about mathmatical formula which can help the daughter to solve the cratical problem that ultimately saved the Earth.
and then they met several decades later, it's really touching.


3) Do you want to go into outer space in the future?
据我所知， 埃隆马斯克已经发明了商业的的太空旅行计划 ， 但是非常的贵， 我想在我有生之年不太可能上太空， 但是这是我美好的幻想
it's a beautiful fantasy of mine. As far as I know, Elon Musk has already launched a commercial space travel program, but it's incredibly expensive. I think it's unlikely that I'll go to space in my lifetime

4) Do you want to know more about outer space?

我从小就对这些东西感兴趣。
我一直关注中国最近的航天进展， 还有比如马斯克的xspace的最新产品
这些都让我非常激动
I've been keeps eye on  China's  advancements in space exploration 
哈珀望远镜的最新发现
The latest discovery from the Telescope
as well as the latest products from Musk's SpaceX. 
All of these developments excite me greatly.


6. Schools
1) Do you go to a good school?
我不知道你指的是哪所学校。我就从我的大学说起吧，虽然我的大学不是一流大学，但我还是要通过竞争才能拿到录取分数。
I'm not sure which school you're referring to. I will start from my university, Although my university is not top-tier, I still had to compete to get a score to get in.



2) What changes would you like to see in your school?
我们的大学坐落在高山上，虽然风景不错，但校园很小。
我听说他们在山脚下建了新的分校。我希望现在的孩子们能有一个宽敞的环境。
Well I would love to see it getting enlarged. our uiniversity is in a moutain.althought it has good scenery , but The campus is quite small。

I  heard they have build the new branch at the foot of the mountain. I wish the kids today can have a spacious environment.


3) Where do you go to school?

The university I attended is located in the southwest of China, in a beautiful city called Chongqing.

4) Do you like your current learning atmosphere?

虽然我已经不在学校了，但我可以谈谈我学生时代的学习环境。

每个人都要参加各种考试、
图书馆经常人满为患，座位供不应求。

学生们非常积极主动。
你总能看到他们在街上奔跑。
Although I'm not in school anymore, I can talk about my learning settings during my student age.

Everyone is involved in all sorts  of examinations, event, or classes
You need to secure a seat early in the library, otherwise, there won't be any left

the students are very proactive.
You can always spot them running on the streets.

5) What are the difference between your school and other schools?

其实，中国大学之间的差别并不大。
最大的区别其实在于学生本身。
好学校的学生会不遗余力地参加各种活动，获取各种资源。
因此，他们会遇到许多志同道合的人，无论他们从事什么活动，都会营造出一种积极向上、充满活力的氛围。

Actually, there isn't much difference among universities in China.
The greatest difference actually lies in the students themselves.


Students at good schools will go to great lengths to participate in various activities and access all kinds of resources. 
As a result, they encounter numerous like-minded individuals, 
No matter what they're engage in, they always create a positive and vibrant atmosphere..

对于科研  政府和机构谁应该投入更多
要看情况
如果是商业项目的话， 有利可图， 又商业利益 ， 不需要政府插手
如果是短期看不到收益但是，但是长期收益巨大的项目， 就应该由政府来主导

It depends on the situation. 
If it's a commercial project that is profitable there's no need for government intervention.
However  if it's a project that doesn't see short-term returns but has huge long-term benefits, it should be led by the government


1) Do you know many small businesses where you live?
在我居住的地方，我是说在慕尼黑，我从未见过什么小型企业、
在我看来，商业主要由大型超市和购物中心占据。
我能看到的只有一些火鸡排档，或者卖咖啡和小吃的机器。
仅此而已，其他的我就没见过了。
For the place where I lived , I mean in munich I never see much small bussiness, 
From my point of view, commercial is mainly dominated by expansive supermarkets and shopping malls. 
I can only see some scattered  turkish  stall, or vending machines offering coffe or snack.


2) Do you prefer buying things in big companies or small businesses?
it depends , 如果是一些大件的商品， 贵一些的东西， 比如家用电器， 我会去打公司买，
small businesses 也有好处 就是这些小摊位经常出现在你住的地方， 非常近， 非常方便而且选择很多， 有一些非常fancy的东西

well it depends, When it comes to buying substantial and pricier items, such as household appliances, I prefer the big companies. 
Because If there are problems for the prodcut, you can always find someone to talk and get a reasonable solution. 
small companies， on the othere hand,  may decline the responsibility or even deny its existence.
you can always find someone to talk and get a reasonable solution when the one you purchased have some problem.  
"You can always find someone to talk to and obtain a reasonable solution when the one you have purchased has some problem.

so there's anthere's a captivating fusion of cultures invoved in small business, 
I would say chrismas supermarket for instance,
wihch they held regularly in munich every year.
there are so many fancy things like food, drinks, or candy in traditional style.
where you can feel the happiness of the local, wihch I found really rewarding.


3) Have you ever worked in small businesses?
没有，但是我认识一下在打工的留学生， 他们一遍打工来支持留学高昂的学费 完成学业
大部分他们会选择一些small bussiness， 因为小公司雇佣更加的灵活， 不会占用太多的精力


 我认识一些留学生，他们通过兼职工作来支付学费。
 I do know some international students who work part-time to support their tuition fees 
 
No, I haven't. However, I do know some international students who work part-time to support their tuition fees  Most of them tend to choose small businesses because these smaller companies offer more flexible employment so they can complete their studies in the same times.


I do know some international students who work for small businesses on a part-time basis.


primarily, I think, is because..

Their reason why they choose to engage with small businesses, 

4) Have you ever thought about starting your own business?
不，我没有。经营一家小企业并不像看起来那么容易。你必须冒很大的风险
现代社会的商业竞争已经相当激烈、
现代商业科学已经很好地控制了利润率。
只要有奇思妙想就能赚大钱的时代已经一去不复返了。
No, I haven't. Running a small business isn't as easy as it seems.
You have to take a lot of risks
The business competition in modern society is already quite intense,


the profit margins has been well controlled by morden science. 

and modern business science has already got the profit margins well controlled. 
The days when you could make a fortune just by having a fancy idea are gone.

Do you often stay up late?
我的回答：

是的，我肯定是个夜猫子，这似乎是最适合我的节奏。在夜深人静的时候，我的注意力会更加集中，思考问题也更深入，更有创造力。无论是做项目还是看书，夜晚的宁静对我来说都是最完美的环境。
Yes, definitely I am a night owl,  
It seems to be the rhythm that suits me best. 
I find it much more easier to concentrate myself in the quiet of the night,
It allows me to think more deeply and creatively. 
Whether I'm working on a project or just reading a book,  the peace of the night is the perfect setting for me.

而白天更容易被各种各样的事情分心，不能静下心来做你想做的事情

And during the day, onthe other hand, it's easier to get distracted by all sorts of things, not being able to settle down to do what you want to do.


Did you stay up late when you were a kid?

小时候，我必须早起上学，但我相信自己天生就有 "夜猫子 "的基因，这让我在白天经常感到困倦。然而，当我有机会熬夜时，我发现自己其实很有活力。
When I was a child, I had to get up early for school,
But I believe I was born with the 'night owl' gene, which often made me feel sleepy during the day.However, 
when I had the opportunity to stay up late, I find that I was actually quite energetic.


What does it feel like the next morning if you stay up late?

只要我睡够了，比如 7 个小时左右，第二天早上就不会有什么特别的感觉。但是，如果我熬过了午餐时间，那我就会感觉非常糟糕，这不好描述，只是一种感觉，我会觉得很压抑，或者只是后悔。

As long as I get enough sleep, say about 7 hours, 
I don't really feel any particular way the next morning.
 However, if I stay up past lunchtime, 
 that makes me feel really bad， 
 Can't really put it into words,I would feel like, depressed, or just regret wasting Half a day.





 ## 卡卡的雅思小屋
# 旅游城市是否也是宜居城市：
well not really I would say
admittedly living in such a city. You can have easy access to stunningly beautiful natural views and some recreatation facilities,
but on the other hand during holidays and on weekends 
such places tend to be teeming with people. You know, holiday makers from other cities and even other contries
these kind of places becames noisy and sometimes even messy and dirty. 
for exampe Oktoberfest, one of the bigest festival in source germany
the subway gets packed with drunk people, and it gets really dirty with broken beer bottles everywhere.
The second reason is that product is such cities are Very likely to be highly priced
which will be translated into a Higher Living cost.
so I think such cities are not a very ideal place to live in.

# Describe an item of clothing that someone gave you
The piece of clothing i'd like to talk aboutis actually a t-shirt which was given by my best friend tim last summer
tim  is really keen on热衷于traveling and almost every time after a trip, he would get me something as a souvenir.

Although most of them are not expensive, 
they are of great sentimental value to me对我很有情感价值,
especially an oversized宽松的 t-shirt he bought in Sanya,
a coastal city海边城市located in southern part of China.
It is made of cotton, which has excellent breathability透气性
and the color of it is my favorite color, purple. 
On the front there is a large print of my favorite animal panda. 
lt is extremely adorable and fluffy毛茸茸的 with black and white fur.


On the back, you can see four capital letters大写字母printed in the middle YOLO, 
which is the abbreviation缩写形式for 'you only live once'. 
you know, this sentence has been my life motto 人生格言，座右铭for so many years.
still remember that the moment saw this t-shirt, I was really surprised and I wa spretty sure 
that tim must have spend tons of time肯定花了很多时间 picking it for me. lt has become my go-to item首选项in my wardrobe 衣柜

I think the best part of this t-shirt is thatit is extremely versatile多面手的，多功能的
,which means it can go with almost everything很百搭.llike it very much.



# 收到的积极建议
I wanna talk about an occasion of receiving a very practical suggestion about study,  
from my best friend Monica. It happened last semester, before the final exam. I often went to the school library to cram for 临时抱佛脚/突击准备 it.  

With so many subjects to review, I felt extremely stressed and anxious. What's worse,  
I felt that I suffered from a shorter attention span 注意力时间变短. I mean, I just couldn't concentrate on my study for a long time.  
Especially, my smartphone seemed to be the biggest distraction 最大的干扰项 for me, tempting 引诱 me to check it from time to time 时不时查看下.  
After I complained about this to my best friend Monica, she highly recommended 高度推荐 me an application,
 which can serve as a lock on my phone, preventing me from scrolling on my phone for a long time 阻止我长时间玩手机.  

According to her introduction, if I run this application 开启    手机应用, 
during the period of time which I have preset in it 在我已经在这个应用当中提前设置好的时间段内, 
say two hours, I couldn't run any other kinds of applications except for answering calls.
Maybe you think it is actually treating the symptoms and not the root cause 可能你觉得这是治标不治本,  
but actually it worked so well on me 在我身上很奏效 and it greatly improved my study efficiency  
极大提升学习效率. Also, with

So I feel that Monica's suggestion is extremely straightforward 简单的，直接的 but effective for it
changed my habit thoroughly 徹底地.


吃饭的时候看手机是坏习惯么
# Is it a bad behavior for people to look at their phone during a meal?
For me, it's kind of impolite. Because you're supposed to, 
like, enjoy the meal and have a conversation with the people you're eating with. 
But, you know, sometimes you just need to check your phone for something important.
I think it actually varies from situation to situation.
You know, in China, many people just can't strike a perfect worklife balance.
I mean, even if they are off work, they are still receiving
messages or even phone calls from their co-workers, clients, and boss.
It means that when they are having meals, they still have to check their phones
from time to time to see whether they just have to deal with some work issues.
For other people, they just have the habit of scrolling on the phone,
watching some videos for fun, to kill time, or maybe to get away from this hectic lifestyle.
In China, you only need one hand to use chopsticks, so many people use the other hand for something else.
like watch short vedio in tiktok 
But if we are talking about something more significant, like having a meal with family
members for a family reunion, or having a meal with important clients, scrolling on your phone
all the time is definitely something bad.
It's definitely a sign of disrespect, which will leave a bad impression on others.


# Have you ever tried anything exciting?
Yes, last summer holiday, l tried surfing in Sanya, a coastal citylocated in southern part of China.
l remember when l was surfing on the stormy sea, l was extremelyfascinated by the adrenaline rush.
That feeling was so unforgettable.
Has anything exciting happened to you recently?
Yes, last weekend, l went hiking with several members from ahiking club in my city.
The moment we reached the top of the mountain, we enjoyed thebeautiful scenery of the sunset.
The sun cast golden hue over everything, which was extremely pictu resque.
I snapped a lot of photos to capture this exciting moment.



**Do you have a talent or something you're good at?**

Yeah, I think I'm really good at learning new things.
 I'm a quick learner. I remember when I was taking calligraphy courses,
  I made huge progress in a shorter time compared to other students.

**Do you think anyone in your family has the same talent?**

I think my dad learns things super fast. It took him only two weeks to get his driver's license.
 Besides that, he also taught himself some basic life skills, like fixing things and plumbing.


Do you think people of all ages need to read?
I don't think so.
Admittedly, reading is a very beneficial and valuable thing,
for it can broaden people's horizons and enrich their knowledge of different views.
In recent years, it has gained more and more popularity.
But the thing is, with the emergence of technological advances,
people now have more options that are even more fascinating and entertaining.
For example, many short videos on social media platforms can also be informative,
educational, and very interesting.
Also, talking with people who are knowledgeable
or simply browsing some news on the internet,
all these can serve as effective ways for us to access information
and keep ourselves updated with what is going on.
So I think reading is not a must in our daily life.
People can choose to read or not to read based on their own preferences.


 ** Do you think your talent can be useful for your future work? Why?

Yeah, I think being a quick learner gives me an edge over others at work. I can master work-related skills faster,
 and my work efficiency will improve a lot.

Was it mastered recently or when you were young?

When I was really young. As a primary school student, I could pick up new skills quickly.
 I guess I could figure out the basic logic of learning instead of just memorizing things.

Hello, today we are going to talk about Part 2, which is the experience of losing things.
There are actually a few difficulties in this topic.
The first one is that a lot of students will have difficulty in choosing what to lose.
The second one is the feeling of losing things.
What did I do after losing things?
It seems to be described in Chinese, but it seems to be more difficult to describe it in English.
Right?
Today, I will answer this question for you one by one.

In addition, this topic can also be linked to other topics.
For example, something that surprises you.
Is it surprising to find something lost again?
If you give more details about the place where you lost something,
can this topic be transformed into a topic about a location?
For example, a quiet river or lake.
Or a place you recommend to tourists.
Right?

So it can still be linked to some topics.
Let's take a look at what the topic itself is.
OK, next, I have written the keywords on a piece of paper.
Let me talk about this answer.
It is 7 to 7.5 points.

Well, last summer holiday, I traveled to the Golden Beach with my best friend.
And we had great fun there that day,
playing various kinds of water sports like surfing.
